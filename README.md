#ToDoList Application by Daniel Hicks
You open this application by clicking the Main Page html Link then the Todo List Application html link that is located in the Final Project section of my Website.

You can use any browser to run this application.

To use this application effectively you just click in the input field where it says add a task and input whatever task that you need to complete.

To let yourself know that you are done with said task you can left click the open circle right beside the task and a line will run through the task letting you know that the task is done.

If you don't want to see that specific anymore you can either press the trashcan icon that is located to the right of your task or click the refresh button that is located at the top right of the application to get an immediate restart of the application.

Any browser is compatible with this application.

It works only on a day by day basis. The date will always show to let you stay on track with whatever you need to complete that specific day.
